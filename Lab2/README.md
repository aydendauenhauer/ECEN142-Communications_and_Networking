This repository contains my Lab 2 report for ECEN 142. In this lab I studied 5G Ethernet transport and 5G LAN-type services from the 3GPP specifications, explaining synchronization mechanisms (IEEE 1588v2 PTP and SyncE), local breakout and multi-access edge computing for low-latency Ethernet routing, and the use of TSN and QoS to support non-IP Ethernet frames. I also analyzed how 5G LAN-type virtual networks provide wide-area LAN-style connectivity, seamless handover across licensed and unlicensed spectrum, and on-demand, secure UE-to-UE, multicast, and broadcast communication for enterprises.
