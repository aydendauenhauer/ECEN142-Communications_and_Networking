This repository contains my Lab 4 project for ECEN 142, implemented in MATLAB. The goal of this lab is to further explore simulated digital communication systems, focusing on how modulation schemes behave in the presence of noise and channel impairments, and how performance metrics such as bit or symbol error rate change with SNR. The repository includes MATLAB live scripts and any helper functions used to generate, transmit, and analyze signals, along with plots that illustrate key behaviors in time and frequency.
