This repository contains my Lab 6 project for ECEN 142. The lab uses MATLAB (live scripts) to simulate and analyze digital communication system behavior, focusing on how system parameters and channel conditions affect performance metrics such as signal quality and error rates. The repository includes the main Lab 6 live script and any supporting functions used to run experiments and generate plots.
