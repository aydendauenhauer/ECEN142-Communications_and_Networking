This repository contains my Lab 7 project for ECEN 142, where I used MATLAB live scripts to simulate and analyze digital communication system behavior, exploring how modulation choices, channel conditions, and system parameters affect signal quality and performance metrics such as bit or symbol error rate. The repository includes the Lab 7 script and any supporting functions or plots generated during the experiments.
