This repository contains my Lab 5 project for ECEN 142, where I used MATLAB to model and compare TDMA and FDMA multiplexing of two baseband users built from sinc pulses. The lab constructs time-division and frequency-division combined signals, examines their spectra with FFTs, then applies demodulation and low-pass filtering to recover an individual user’s signal and study the effects of noise and filter design on reconstruction quality.
