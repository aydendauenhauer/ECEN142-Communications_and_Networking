# ECEN142-Communications_and_Networking
This repository contains my ECEN 142 – Communications and Networking lab. The goal of these assignments is to practice core concepts in modern communication systems and computer networks, including signal transmission over noisy channels, modulation and demodulation, link budgets, error detection and correction, as well as networking fundamentals such as layering, routing, congestion control, and basic protocol analysis. The repository includes MATLAB simulation scripts. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in ECEN 142, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own. Follow SCU’s academic integrity policies.
